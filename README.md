To start the react application, you need to open the console in the application directory and enter the command "npm start", then the browser will open the application itself or go to "http://localhost:3000"

P.S: If you run the application for the first time, then you need to execute the command "npm i" to install all the necessary nodes_modules

To run the e2e test, you need to run the react application at "http://localhost:3000" and enter the command "npm test" in the console
